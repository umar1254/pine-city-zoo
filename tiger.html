                <h3>TIGER</h3>
                <p>Size and Weight: Tigers are the largest cats on Earth, with adults weighing up to 720 pounds (363 kg) and measuring up to 6 feet (2 meters) in length. The Siberian tiger is the biggest subspecies. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Unique Stripes: Each tiger has a unique pattern of stripes, much like human fingerprints. These stripes help them blend into their environment, providing camouflage while hunting.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Hunting Behavior: Tigers are solitary hunters, typically stalking their prey at night. They rely on stealth and strength, often dragging their prey into cover to eat. </p>
                <p> <strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
